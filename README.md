This animation visualizes the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges. 
The graph is displayed with nodes and weighted edges, and during the algorithm's execution,
the source node is highlighted in yellow, the current node being processed is shown in red, and all other nodes are highlighted in green. 
As the algorithm iterates, the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes are updated and displayed, 
illustrating the step-by-step computation of shortest paths.
